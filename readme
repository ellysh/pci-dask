This file describes the installation and configuration for PCIS-DASK Linux Driver


STEP 1: UNPACK
==============

Decompress the package file:
     tar xvzf [filename].tar.gz

This will extract the 'pci-dask_427' directory with the following
subdirectories:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
drivers/ contains the device modules, configuration file and
         installation script
lib/     contains the shared library - libpci_dask.so
util/    contains the configuration utility and un-installation
         script
samples/ contains some sample programs for ADLink DAQ devices
docs/    documentation

* The drivers are compiled as kernel modules and now work for
  kernel versions 2.6.32-28-generic
  ( compiled with gcc version 4.4.3 (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5) )


STEP 2: RESERVE MEMORY
======================

*** Note: If your DO NOT perform any continuous operation, ***
***       you can skip this section and jump to STEP 3.    ***

For contiguous memory allocation, we reserve memory in higher memory space.
And to reserve higher memory for drivers, user should pass a command line
argument to the kernel. User can either use "append=" in /etc/lilo.conf or
add commandline arguments to the Lilo interactive prompt at boot time.
If you add "append=" in /etc/lilo.conf, you should execute /sbin/lilo to
update the setting.

For example, 64MB RAM installed in you box and 4MB reserved memory is needed:

  * if you use LILO as boot loader, you can add "append=" statement to the
    file "/etc/lilo.conf".

    In lilo.conf:
    boot=/dev/hda
    install=/boot/boot.b
    prompt
    timeout=50
    default=linux

    image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.xx
        label=linux
        read-only
        root=/dev/hda1
        append="mem=60M"

  * if you use GRUB as boot loader, you can add "mem=" statement to the file
    "/etc/grub.conf".

    In grup.conf:
    deafult=0
    timeout=10
    splashimage=(hd0,0)/boot/grub/splash.xpm.gz
    title SUSE Linux
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.xx ro root=/dev/hda1 mem=60M

* If you add "append=" in /etc/lilo.conf, you should execute /sbin/lilo to
  update the setting.

Or, you can specify the command line arguments to the interactive prompt
at boot time:
   * LILO
    LILO: linux mem=60M

   * GRUB
    i. Press 'a' to modify the kernel arguments.
    ii. ro root=/dev/hda1 mem=60M

Please note that MEM setting should not larger than 3072M, due to the 
limitation of 32bit kernel.

STEP 3: CONFIGURE AND INSTALL DEVICE
===================================

Because of the PCI-bus architecture, the NuDAQ PCI devices can be detected
automatically. All user has to do is inserting modules and making nodes for
the devices.

You can finish these manually, or ultilize the applets we provide.

    pci-dask_427/util/dask_conf           for driver configuration
    pci-dask_427/drivers/dask_inst.pl     for driver installation

To configure drivers, execute the utility:

   pci-dask_427/util/dask_conf

The detailed description of dask_conf can be found in Chapter 3 of
User Guide.

To make driver installation, execute the script as follows:

   pci-dask_427/drivers/dask_inst.pl


STEP 4: INSTALL LIBRARY
=======================

The library is provided as a shared library. The library is compatible
with GLIBC 2.10. To install the library, type the following command:

   cp <InstallDir>/pci-dask_427/lib/libpci_dask.so /usr/lib

In addition, dask_inst.pl also involves the installation for the library.
